### sup, i'm purplik
in june of 2024 i've  graduated from an art school where i took computer game and multimedia application development classes and i currently work as a qa tester as my fulltime job.



### skills
- game development - godot, unity
- java, c#, python, c++



### interests
- [`outer wilds`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/) - my most favorite game ever and i'd recommend everyone to play it
- magic & alchemy - i like magic. stuff like noita's spell casting or thaumcraft's vis and essentia systems (i also like eldritch related themes and cosmic horror)



### my projects
- [`risk of math`](https://github.com/PurplikDev/Risk-Of-Math)
  - web calculator made in javascript for [`risk of rain 2`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/) items
  - it doesn't have all the items (i was lazy, and now after release of seekers of the storm i lost all motivation and hope for this franchise (thank you gearbox!!! >:c))
- [`project soul`](https://github.com/PurplikDev/Project-Soul)
  - my graduation project
  - made in unity
  - stopped working on it because i graduated, transitioned to godot and also realized the project had way too many fundemental design flaws that fixing it would take more effort compared to just starting from scratch



### practise projects
- [`dredge-like`](https://github.com/PurplikDev/dredge-like) - after playing [`dredge`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1562430/DREDGE/) i really wanted to recreate it's water and ship
- [`rise of todmoldren recreation`](https://github.com/PurplikDev/rise-of-todmoldren-recreation) - recreation of my first ever game in godot
