<h1 style=style="align: center;"> Hello everyone, I'm Purplik </h1>

Somehow you found my GitHub profile. Congratulations.

## Well, since you are here I might as well say what I do

I like to play games. My favorite ones are TF2, DRG, RoR2, Starbound and Minecraft. _You might notice a pattern there._
Speaking of games, I also make mods for Minecraft, most notable one would be my cosmetic mod [Hats & Cosmetics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hats-cosmetics "CurseForge page").

I also like making games using Unity. My current project is a rogulike game inspired by Azanor's [Thaumcraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thaumcraft "CurseForge page").


## Something more about me

I like music.
My favorite album is Pinkerton.

My favorite color is Purple.
Which is also origin of my nickname.

_What else is there to say? Hmmm_

I have a Twitter account where I post Minecraft art when I'm bored.

And yeah... that's about it.
Enjoy your stay here, and don't make a mess when you dig though my repositories.
