### sup, i'm purplik
i'm an indie game developer that really likes godot, maybe a bit too much.
i've recently graduated from a an art school where i took computer game and multipedia application development classes.



### skills
- game development - godot, unity and unreal engine
- java, c#, html, css, javascript, python, c++
- video editing - adobe premiere, davinci resolve
- graphical design - ui design and very amature pixel art



### interests
- gaming - i mostly like roguelikes like [`noita`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/), but i'm also a big enjoyer of [`voices of the void`](https://mrdrnose.itch.io/votv)
- modding - trying to find flaws in games i enjoy is a bad habit of mine, but thanks to modding i can turn this bad habit into a creative hobby that allows me to "fix" these flaws and improve on them
- music - i'm a big music enjoyer, i really like bands like `molchat doma`, `king gizzard & the lizard wizard`, `radiohead` and many other, i also enjoy soundtracks from video games and shows `disco elysium` and `murder drones`
- content creation - it's just a small hobby i picked up during covid, i really like sharing my experiences with other people
- magic & alchemy - i like magic. stuff like noita's spell casting or thaumcraft's vis and essentia systems (i also like eldritch related themes and cosmic horror)



### my current projects
- [`console game`](https://github.com/PurplikDev/console-game) - [early in development]
  - inspired by `voices of the void`
  - the game takes place entirely in a console made in godot
  - everything is done via the console, this includes the gameplay, settings, managing save files and other weird things i come up with
- krtk! - [very early in development]
  - `hotline miami` inspired party game
  - small-ish project with couple of friends
  - you play as moles btw, can't reveal much more
- [`magic roguelike`](https://github.com/PurplikDev/magic-roguelike) - [in development]
  - small attempt at `bringing thaumcraft 4`'s dungeon mechanic into a standalone game with an expanded spell system



### my other projects
- [`hats & cosmetics`](https://github.com/PurplikDev/Hats-and-Cosmetics) [![Curse Forge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/594678.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hats-cosmetics)
  - mod that adds hats & cosmetics into minecraft
  - the mod is currently on hold due to transition from the forge api to neoforge api
- [`explorer's gear`](https://github.com/PurplikDev/explorers-gear) [![Curse Forge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/967918.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/explorers-gear)
  - this mod adds few useful items into minecraft based on the bundle item
  - similarly to hats & cosmetics the mod is on hold due to api transition and also changes to the bundle item in the base game
- [`darkest stress`](https://github.com/PurplikDev/darkest-stress) [![Curse Forge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/674856.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/darkest-stress)
  - this mod adds the stress system from darkest dungeon into minecraft
  - it was created for a roguelike modpack by a development team which was unfortunately never released
- [`risk of math`](https://github.com/PurplikDev/Risk-Of-Math)
  - web calculator made in javascript for [`risk of rain 2`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/) items
  - it doesn't have all the items (i was lazy, and now after release of seekers of the storm i lost all motivation and hope for this franchise (thank you gearbox!!! >:c))
- [`project soul`](https://github.com/PurplikDev/Project-Soul)
  - my graduation project
  - made in unity
  - stopped working on it because i graduated, transitioned to godot and also realized the project had way too many fundemental design flaws that fixing it would take more effort compared to just starting from scratch



### practise projects
- dredge-like - after playing [`dredge`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1562430/DREDGE/) i really wanted to recreate it's water and ship
- rise of todmoldren recreation - recreation of my first ever game in godot
- tactical fps controller - attempt at trying to create a template for tactical fps games in godot in case i needed it sometime in the future
